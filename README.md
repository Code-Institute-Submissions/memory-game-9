# Artist Memory

- This is the first time I've designed a memory game. I didn't know where to start at first so it was quite challenging
to say the least. This game uses a 3d animation technique that was not taught in the course so I am excited to 
show it off. In fact, there were a few other techniques that were not taught in the course as well but I digress.

- I decided to go with a music artist theme because I am musician and a lover of music. The artists used
on the cards are just a few of some of my favorites and span across a few different musical eras, starting from the 1960's 
moving onward. 
 
## UX
 
- This website is for anyone looking to pass the time with a quick memory game. We've all played one before so
it's easy to understand and it does not need explanation in order to get started. Not to mention it's good for the 
brain to practice memorization from time to time, even if it is just a simple card game. 


## Features

- The features are very simple. You click a card, the timer starts, and you see how quickly you can match all the cards. 
 
### Existing Features
- The flip feature allows the timer to start. 
- There's a lockboard implemented so that you can only flip one set of cards at a time. 
- A timer feature to show how much time is left.

### Features Left to Implement
- I wanted to implement background music, a stop timer function, a move counter, and a more appealing aesthetic
but I ran out of time. 

## Technologies Used

- In this project, I used html, css, and javascript. I used YouTube as my tutor to create a skeleton for the project
as well as learn how to implement the timer feature. 

- I used google images to find all the pictures for this project.

## Testing

- Upon testing the final draft, the barebones functions work. The project does what it was intended to do. 

- The project also works well and looks good not only on desktop, but tablets phones as well. 

- The only bug that comes to mind is with the timer. Once all cards match, the timer keeps counting down until it reaches 0.


## Deployment

I deployed the project using github. The code was tested and created using gitpod
